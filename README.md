# Hadoop MapReduce
This repository contains a Java implementation of a Hadoop MapReduce program as part of my cloud computing coursework. This is developed through GCP to create n-grams using 10,000 e-book titles taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Specifically, the program creates sequences of 4 consecutive words.
